<pre class="western">MFM - MAME File Manager
Author Phweda from PleasureDome</pre>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Original intent :</span> <br>
    Create a simple program with a GUI for creating playlist(s) and extracting a
    play set of MAME Roms, CHDs and Extras to another location from complete or
    larger sets.</p>
<pre class="western"></pre>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Added : </span><br>
    Basic Front end capabilities to; view and create play lists, view game
    information, launch MAME games, run MAME commands <br>
    GUI layout based upon MAMEUI http://www.mameui.info/ - loved it but as the
    number of MAME games in 2011 has exploded MAMEUI has become very slow for me</p>
<pre class="western"></pre>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Goals :</span> <br>
    Keep as generic and flexible as reasonably possible. <br>
    Usable on both Windows and Linux as seamlessly as possible. <br>
    Decoupled from MAME to minimize code changes based on MAME changes while
    exposing as much MAME functionality as possible. <br>
    Support importing/using multiple 'list' types IE CatVer.ini, MAMEUI favorites
    etc. <br>
    Optimize performance for regular usage at the expense of initial setup and
    loading of large information sets such as listing of complete MAME Game List
    and Game information.</p>
<pre class="western"> </pre>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Requirements :</span> <br>
    You have Java 1.7 JRE installed. <br>
    You have MAME installed, configured and operating correctly. <br>
    You have a basic understanding of how MAME works. <br>
    Your ROMs and CHDs are correct for your version of MAME.</p>
<pre class="western"><br></pre>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">MFM will not :</span> <br>
    Audit or manage ROMs in any way except for the intended copying a subset of
    PLAYABLE games to a different location. See <a
            href="http://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/">clrmamepro</a> to scan and rebuild
    your sets. </p>
<pre class="western"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bugs and TODOs in file MFM-bugs.html</span>
</pre>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Coding NOTES :</span></p>

<p><br>
    RECOMMENDED JVM Options for testing</p>

<p>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -Xloggc:./Logs/MFM_GC_log.txt -Xms64m -Xmx256m <br>
    <br>
    Logging <br>
    ********** Look for information and expected Exceptions here ************* <br>
    - MFM_Debug_log(6 digits).txt <br>
    <br>
    ********** Look for unexpected Exceptions here ************* <br>
    - MFM_ERRout_log(6 digits).txt <br>
    <br>
    - MFM_GC_log.txt REQUIRES -Xloggc:./Logs/MFM_GC_log.txt JVM Option </p>

<p></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Inconsistencies </span><br>
    - some are deliberate (practice new or different methodologies) <br>
    - some are usage of very old code not updated <br>
    - Or I just messed up<br>
    <br>
