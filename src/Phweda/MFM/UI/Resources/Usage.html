<h1>MAME FILE MANAGER User Instructions</h1>

<h2>Settings View</h2>

<p>MFM on the first run takes you to the Settings View. You enter your MAME exe
    and directories information. You can change these at any time by selecting
    <span style="font-style: italic;">MFM -&gt; Settings<br>
</span></p>
<ol>
    <li>Select your MAME exe</li>
    <li>Select your full ROMs set directory . Can be a parent or ancester
        directory but doing this will increase search times
    </li>
    <li>Select your full CHDs set directory, if different from ROMs</li>
    <li>Select your full EXTRAs set directory</li>
    <li>Select your Videos set directory</li>
    <li>Select parent directory where you want your PLAYABLE game resources
        placed
        <ul>
            <li>If MFM does not find needed directories in the MAME Play directory it
                will create them i.e. "artwork", "bkground", "cabinets", "chd",
                "cpanel", "flyers", "icons", "manuals", "marquees", "pcb", "roms",
                "samples", "snap", "titles"
            </li>
            <li><span style="color:#ff0000">WARNING !</span> MFM will overwrite
                existing files in those directories - this should not be an issue but
                if you have older version files you want to keep please use a new
                directory for MFM to manage
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>When you save your settings the first time MFM will run MAME to get all
    games information for this version of MAME. NOTE this may take a few minutes
    depending on your system. When completed you will be brought to the main view
    with a single list of all PLAYABLE games for this MAME version. This is the
    Game List view</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Create List View</h2>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">List -&gt; Create List</span></p>

<p>In the right hand panel you can type in Game names. Click the <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">Pick Games</span> button at the top to open
    a game picker to select games. In the picker you can double click on a game
    name to add it to the list. Or select the game and use the <span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">Add</span> button. The picker has a basic
    lookup capability. Start to type in a name and it will traverse to it. At the
    bottom of the panel enter the name of this list. When you are finished click
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Create Play List</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">LIST -&gt; MyLists</span></p>

<p>By default includes built in lists: ALL, CLONE, NOCLONE, <a
        href="http://forum.pleasuredome.org.uk/index.php?showtopic=25093&amp;page=1">PD
    VIDs</a>, VERTICAL</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">List -&gt; Populate</span> Populate a
    list. This will search for all associated files for this game and copy them to
    your play directories. While populating a small red clock arm will be visible
    at the window bottom center of the statusbar.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">List -&gt; Save List to File</span> Saves
    selected list game names to a text file in &lt;MFM Root&gt;/Lists</p>

<p><br>
    NOTE : until you have populated a list or manually moved the ROMs/CHDs the
    games will not be playable from MFM if you have the standard mame.ini setup</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Command View</h2>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Command -&gt; MAME Command
Builder</span></p>

<p>Lists all of the MAME commands in a dialog. Double click and the command
    will be added to the textfield. For new commands to be saved add entry to drop
    down box and click Save. Run executes the command currently displayed in the
    textfield.</p>

<p>Command window output appear in the MAME_OUTPUT log.</p>

<p style="color:#ff0000">NOTE piping command output to file is not supported in
    0.5 release - we are calling MAME without a command shell</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Font Size and Look &amp; Feel</h2>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">UI -&gt; Font Size</span>
    Increases/Dedreases the font size. NOTE: this is done by a very basic HACK.
    Java does not provide a universal UI font setting. So it is hit or miss and if
    you change the Look &amp; Feel it will get partially or completely
    overridden.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">UI -&gt; Look &amp; Feel</span> Select any
    of the available L&amp;F for your platform. NOTE: you will find with certain
    L&amp;Fs that there will be 'bugs' in the layout and function of the UI. Coding
    and testing for every L&amp;F is beyond the current scope of this project.</p>

<p>0.4 adds support for: JGoodies http://www.jgoodies.com/ - SeaGlass
    https://seaglass.googlecode.com - JTattoo http://www.jtattoo.net/index.html </p>

<p>Place jars into &lt;MFM Root&gt;/JARs</p>

<p>Jars\seaglasslookandfeel-0.2.jar</p>

<p>Jars\jgoodies-looks-2.6.0.jar</p>

<p>Jars\jgoodies-common-1.7.0.jar</p>

<p>Jars\JTattoo-1.6.10.jar</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Video Menu</h2>

<p>VDub &amp; FFmpeg are available based on the PD Vids project needs. You must
    have them properly installed and the FFmpeg project version.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Video -&gt; VDub</span> opens VDub. If the
    selected game in the list has an AVI file in your MFM configured video sets
    directory that file will open into VDub.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Video -&gt; FFmpeg</span> opens a dialog
    to set or confirm FFmpeg exe location and your input(AVI files) and output(MP4)
    directories. </p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Convert
Files</span> button runs FFmpeg. DO NOT close MFM during this operation. MFM
    runs FFmpeg file by file. FFmpeg output is captured in &lt;MFM
    Root&gt;/Logs/FFmpeg_OUT--&lt;number&gt;.txt</p>

<p></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Video -&gt; Extract GIF Images</span>
    <span style="color:#ff0000">WARNING !</span> Memory hog. Increase memory to at
    least -Xmx384m</p>
